# HBX-mobile-app-APIs
Specifications and resources for mobile apps needed by the HBX mobile app

## Context 
### _How does the Mobile App call the EnrollApp APIs?_
1. The mobile app connects to IAM, passing user credentials, to retrieve a valid SAML token
2. The mobile app connects to the EnrollApp session API to establish a session, passing the SAML token
3. The mobile app calls an API from within that session

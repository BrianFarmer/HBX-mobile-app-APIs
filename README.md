# HBX-mobile-app-APIs
Specifications and resources for mobile apps needed by the HBX mobile app

## APIs needed - Simple Broker App

Iteration 0 of the mobile app targets SHOP brokers, and allows them to do easy management of SHOP employer clients.

The MVP will use existing IAM & EnrollApp security systems, and not require any changes to HBX's security systems.

The MVP will require a couple of specific new API endpoints to yield broker data.

The following JSON payloads provide the information that the mobile app needs for the Broker MVP:
   `GET http://enroll.dchealthlink.com/broker_agencies/profiles/employers_api?id=<broker id>`
     The following JSON payload is returned:
     * [schema](enroll/broker/employers_list/response/schema.json)
     * [example](enroll/broker/employers_list/response/example.json)
    
## Future Possibilities

### Expanded Broker App 

The MVP API could be extended, or more endpoints added, to include:
 - roster/enrollment/participation information
 - employer plan offerings information
 - payment and invoice information


### Employer App
 - roster management
 - employee coverage information

Additional versions could target additional customer groups including Employee and Individual users, providing shopping, verification, upload, notifications, etc.
